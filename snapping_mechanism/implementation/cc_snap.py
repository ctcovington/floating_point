    """ Implementation of the Snapping Mechanism from Mironov (2012)

    This class presents an implementation of the Snapping Mechanism developed in Mironov (2012)
    (paper found at http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.366.5957&rep=rep1&type=pdf). The mechanism
    and associated proofs are described in section 5.2 of the paper.

    The mechanism was developed in order to avoid vulnerabilities in the Laplace Mechanism due to imprecise
    floating-point calculations. The 'snapping' can be thought of (loosely) as rounding the final output (input + laplace noise) such that
    potential output values are spaced slightly more than lambda apart.

    The mechanism itself is a little different than many others in that it takes the non-private statistic as an argument
    (it could theoretically be rewritten to take the raw data as an argument as well). That is, the noise is a function of
    the non-private statistic (among other things).

    Big thanks to Daniel Alabi and Ira Globus-Harris for their help. Daniel helped point me in the right direction with regards
    to rounding via IEEE representation manipulation. Ira came up with the main idea we eventually used for the IEEE
    manipulation, wrote the first implementation of it, and was very helpful in general with ideas and feedback on various
    piece of the implementation.

    Attributes:
        mechanism_input (numeric): Raw (non-private) value of statistic for which you want a private release
        sensitivity (numeric): Sensitivity of function generating mechanism input
        epsilon (numeric): DP-epsilon
        B (numeric): Suggested bound on the mechanism_input, corresponds to B from Mironov

    Methods:
        get_snapped_noise: Returns epsilon-DP noise in according with snapping mechanism

    Example:
        snap_object = Snapping_Mechanism(50, 0.012, 0.001, 200)
        snapped_noise = snap_object.get_snapped_noise()
