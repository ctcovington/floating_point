- maybe just look at raw difference between mean of clipped data and private mean
    - DONE
- read again to check on assumptions -- why is clamping happening after the calculation of the mean?
    - DONE
    - it's not -- f(D) defined as every part of the laplace mechanism, save for the noise addition, so f(D) would include clipping of the data if f is a mean function
- try snapping mechanism on neighboring datasets (one with major outlier)
    - not necessary now because data are being clamped
- try looking at distributions of behavior over each combination of parameters
    - could just do mean, median, high/low if dist takes too long
    - get better sense for why big differences are happening
- try making lb/ub an argument to test
    - DONE
- try lognormal as well as normal data generation
- can hold mean constant
    - DONE
